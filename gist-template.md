# Lookaheads and Lookbehinds in Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are useful tools that help you search for patterns in text. Lookaheads and lookbehinds are advanced regex features that let you check if a pattern comes before or after another pattern, without including that extra pattern in the final match. These techniques help ensure a match is correct based on the surrounding text, but they donâ€™t capture or include that surrounding text in the result.
